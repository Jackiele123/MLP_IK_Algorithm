# An Inverse Kinematic Solution Derived with Machine Learning
This project is an extension of my 6-DOF Robotic Arm 3D Website which can be found here:
[My3DWebsite](https://project.jackiele.ca/)

This project applies two seperate implementation of a multi-layer perceptron, one coded from scratch and the other using keras. The main goal of this project was to research the viability of machine learning for the derivation of a inverse kinematic solution for my 6-DOF Robotic Arm. To find out more please read my comprehensive research paper.
